Android emulator (via android sdk) and docker cannot run simultaniously

Reason:
	avds use HAXM virtualization
	docker use Hyper-v virtualization
Both cannot run at the same time (as of 25-03-2018)
Thus for android development the Hyper-v should be turned off and for docker hosting hyper-v should be turned on.
To do so:
    For turning off:
	Open an CMD with admin privs => use command "bcdedit /set {current} hypervisorlaunchtype off" to turn off hyper-v.
    For turning on:
	Open an CMD with admin privs => use command "bcdedit /set {current} hypervisorlaunchtype auto" to turn on hyper-v.

NOTICE: when switching settings in bcdedit, the computer needs to be restart for settings to take effect. (this is due to hyper-v being enabled/disabled on boot.
